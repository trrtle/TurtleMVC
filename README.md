MVC stands for Model View Controller.
it is a building pattern that separates an application into three main components: The model, the view and the controller.
Each of these components are built to handle a specific tasks of an application. MVC is one of the most used web development
frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects.

The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic-related data. For example, a Customer object will retrieve the customer information from the database, manipulate it and update it data back to the database or use it to render data.
