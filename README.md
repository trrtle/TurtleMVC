## <a name="whatismvc"> What is a MVC framework? </a>


MVC stands for Model View Controller.
it is a building pattern that separates an application into three main components: The model, the view and the controller.
Each of these components are built to handle a specific tasks of an application. MVC is one of the most used web development
frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects.

### <a name="view">View</a>
The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. This component is what the user sees and interacts with.

### <a name="controller">Controller</a>
The controller is the middle man. It controls which view will be loaded and the kind of data is being send with it.

### <a name="model">Model</a>
The model component handels all the data related logic that the user works with. For example, a user object wil retrieve all the user information from the database, manipulate it in the view and update it back to the database or use it to render data.
